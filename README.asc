= What is it?
catalog_entities is a database of Postgres catalog metadata for each version of
Postgres. It makes it easy to see changes that were made to the Postgres
catalog between different versions.

= Why would I wast this?
This is handy for creating tools that need to work across multiple versions of
Postgres. It is especially useful in supporting code generation based on
catalog metadata.

= Installing
== Dependencies
catalog_entities depends on the https://github.com/decibel/cat_tools[cat_tools]
extension. The simplest way to install it is:

```
# Install pgxn if it doesn't exist
which pgxn > /dev/null || sudo -H pip install pgxnclient
# Now install cat_tools
pgxn install cat_tools
```

== Install
`load.sh` will create a new Postgres database with full catalog information. It
requires the name of a database. It also accepts any psql options that also
work with dropdb and createdb.

WARNING: load.sh will drop the specified database if it already exists!

Example:

```
./load.sh catalog_entities
```

= Provided data

`catalog_relations` is the raw table that contains catalog attribute
information for each version.

`latest` lists information for the most recent version in `catalog_relations`.
`latest_expanded` explodes the attribute information, providing one row for
every attribute in every relation, instead of one row per relation.


`current_version_delta` and `current_version_relation` both inspect the catalog
tables in the database. These are "live" and their contents depend on the
version of Postgres that the database is running in. They are used by other
scripts to update `catalog_relations`.
